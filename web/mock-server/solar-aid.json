Good to look at the social impact calculator that solar aid has - http://www.solar-aid.org/online-impact-calculator/	£6,191,995	£821,599	£109,121	2%	Reserves taken from note 16. This figure looks low. Could there be other reserves held within the Sunnymoney entity? The comments on page 8 indicate that the target is 3 months, and they are planning to build back up to this level, which presumably means that they acknowledge their reserves are too low.	You enabled access to XXXX solar lights, well done!	Yes	High	Plenty of information provided, and it seems to align with independently conducted calcs, as far as they can be checked			Multiple meetings and emails				A	5	Impact seems high, with beneficiaries enjoying health impacts, improved education, and there are climate change benefits too. Coudl look at GWWC's research, but it's incomplete: https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/reports/SolarAid%20Report.pdf
