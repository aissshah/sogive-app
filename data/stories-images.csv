Macmillan Cancer support,"When Dave was diagnosed with prostate cancer it came as a huge shock. Loneliness was particularly difficult to deal with, as Dave had lost his wife to cancer in 2008. 

Thankfully, Gill, a Macmillan nurse, was there to support him from the point of diagnosis onwards.

‘Gill helped me through the most difficult period of my life. How can you quantify the support of someone who has listened to you when you’ve been down, who’s listened to you when you’ve been excited, and who has kept in touch to make sure that everything is going okay, and given you all the encouragement and help you need, whenever and however often you need it? She’s just an amazing lady.’ 

Dave also greatly valued the help he received from the Macmillan Support Line and Online Community. These vital sources of support helped him put things in perspective and get answers to his questions.

‘All of it helped because you know you’re not on your own. I shudder to think where I’d be without Macmillan.’",,p16-17 of 2015 accounts: http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Accounts/Ends17/0000261017_AC_20151231_E_C.pdf

Barnardos,"Barnardo’s provides support to children with families experiencing a range of adversities, for example young carers.

Young carers help look after a member of the family who is sick, disabled or has mental health problems, or is misusing drugs or alcohol. Their day to day responsibilities often include cooking, cleaning, shopping, providing nursing and personal care and giving emotional support.

With so many adult responsibilities, young carers often miss out on opportunities that other children have to play and learn. Many struggle educationally and are often bullied for being ‘different’. They can become isolated, with no relief from the pressures at home. They are often afraid to ask for help as they fear letting the family down or being taken into care.

Barnardo’s runs services across the UK to help young carers and their families find the support they need, and are entitled to, from local services, so that a child’s caring responsibilities can be reduced. We support them to use local services such as sports clubs, support groups, and health centres. We provide advice and emotional support through counselling and drop-in sessions, and liaise with schools so that teachers can better support their students. We also provide opportunities for young carers to take a break from their caring responsibilities, spend time with other young carers and share experiences.",,

At the end of their life, people should
have the choice to stay at home
where they’re comfortable – with
their loved ones around them.
Our nurses bring comfort
through the hardest times
Aisha’s father-in-law Mohammed
was diagnosed with interstitial
lung disease two years ago. Our
nurses cared for him at home in
the final months of his life.
“The extraordinary commitment
the Marie Curie Nurses showed
Dad is beyond words. He was cared
for with love, dignity and respect.
Having a nurse there meant Mum
could finally get some sleep.
“He was an amazing, strong man
– an angel taken from us far too
soon.
“We very much appreciate that
Dad’s last days were spent at home
with his family, and that wouldn’t
have been possible without the
support and care he had at home

Women for women international,"Beatrice is a widow raising five children, including two girls and three boys. “I heard about Women for Women from my sister who graduated from the programme six years ago. She encouraged me to join, and to make sure that I participated fully, in order to reap the full benefit of the programme.”

Beatrice has a plot of land that she farms, which provides the main source of food for her family. “I only sell produce after taking care of my family’s needs. Before the programme, I did not have any other source of income, and my circumstances were very difficult. Things got worse when a man in my village contested my ownership of the piece of land,” says Beatrice.

“Through the trainings, I summoned up the courage to settle the matter of land ownership.” Beatrice took her case to the local court. “I made my case, and presented my ownership documents for the land as proof that I was the rightful owner. That very day the case was resolved and the land was confirmed as mine. The man who tried to contest my land was told to stay away from it. I found my courage and my voice, and today, I remain the owner of the land.”

Beatrice grows palm trees and other crops on her land, and she plans to continue to use what she harvests to support her family. “I am happy that I got back both my land and the palms that grow on it. They will continue to feed my family and help me to earn some money,” says Beatrice.",http://www.womenforwomen.org.uk/what-we-do/stories/my-name-beatrice,http://www.womenforwomen.org.uk/what-we-do/stories/my-name-beatrice

Down's syndrome association,"Haydon: Ever since his brother Luke started playing football, Haydon had loved to watch and play footie with him in the garden.

When Haydon was 11, we were put in touch with one of our local Clubs, Sporting 87 who were known for being really well set up and for integrating children with special needs into their programmes.

The guys at Sporting 87 could not do enough for us including asking the Suffolk Football association if Haydon could play 2 years down at under 9’s instead of under 11’s to give him a chance whilst learning the rules etc.

Having played myself for over 30 years I was a little worried as to how he would get on and how the other boys would take to him, but I needn’t have been.

He was accepted straight away as a member of the team.  The boys make sure he is where he needs to be during the game and always make sure he is included in the goal celebrations (which he absolutely loves even to the point of him now taking all of the free kicks and penalties they get and you should see them all celebrate together!!)

It does bring tears to our eyes when even opposition parents are cheering and clapping him when he shows his skill or scores a goal. I think it is a testament to organisations such Sporting 87 and DSActive, that people with Down’s syndrome are now included more in sport in their communities.

Playing football and interacting with the boys has done so much for Haydon’s confidence, speech and general communication skills.  He now plays for his own school and is a bit of a star there too I believe!

The photos are from a Sporting 87 tournament last year which was judged not on score, but on skills, passing and sportsmanship.  Haydon’s team won. Suffice it to say that every boy in the team wanted Haydon to receive the cup on their behalf. I cannot say enough about them or their coach Trevor.

Sporting 87 have turned Haydon’s dreams into reality.

The DSActive programme is the only bespoke football and tennis programme for people with Down’s syndrome in the UK.",,

Pratham,"Narrated by Surendra Kumar, Uttar Pradesh, Science program Master Trainer.

Sumit is a mischievous boy living in a village in Uttar Pradesh, India. He heads the gang of similarly mischievous children. Even though he goes to school, he studies only when he wants to and usually spends his time playing games, loitering around, making mischief or picking up fights. 

I invited him to join the other children in the science exploratory. When they all arrived, I asked the children to sit so that I could talk with them. All the children followed my instruction except for Sumit who was examining his surroundings very carefully.

When I asked him to sit again he replied by saying that he will do so very soon and continued to stare at one of the models. The model was that of a magnetic train which had a pencil floating mid-air. I pretended not to take notice.

I asked Sumit to sit once again and told him that the model will still be there after we finish talking. On hearing this, Sumit finally sat down. However, while the other children were listening to what I had to say, Sumit still seemed to be thinking about the train. After speaking with the children, I decided to show them some films about scientific toys and experiments by Arvind Gupta. This was the first time that the children were seeing a film on the projector. The children watched 7 to 8 films attentively. The films were about making paper caps, paper houses, a small book with 14 pages, magical match sticks and dancing man. All the children enjoyed watching the films but Sumit seemed to enjoy them the most. 

When the children were tasked with making the same scientific toys, Sumit was the first one to finish making the paper cap and was soon helping other children with it. Eventually, Sumit saw a paper crocodile that was sitting right next to the model that had caught Sumit's fancy initially. Sumit picked the paper crocodile and looked at it closely. 

At the end of the day, Sumit had spent 3 hours with the rest of the children and had not picked up fights, loitered around or indulged in any mischief. When it was time to go home Sumit came to me and said that he can make the magnetic train if he gets the magnets. I gave him the magnets and with little guidance he made the model which he was so fascinated about. His joy knew no bounds 

The next day, the students brought some of the scientific toys that they had created at home. Each child had made one or two other models, Sumit, however, had made them all.

""Look! Magical matchstick"", he said as he entered the classroom, ""A crocodile!""

He even started reading Arvind Gupta's book on scientific toys and experiments. 

Perhaps Sumit truly enjoyed participating in the activities of the science exploratory. Perhaps this is what he wants to do. His desire to learn and achieve something different is hard to miss.

Sumit is now participating in the summer camp at the science exploratory. ",http://www.pratham.org/impact/case-studies,http://www.pratham.org/impact/case-studies
