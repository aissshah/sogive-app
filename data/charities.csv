However it gives no indication of how widespread this is; while I am confident that there are some cultures who would ostracise children with a cleft palate, I would speculate that a material proportion (maybe the majority?) of the children helped were in fact quite happy with their lives before the intervention, and that while the intervention would have been (presumably) viewed positively by the beneficiary and his/her family at the time, would likely have done little to improve their lives (note that this is pure speculation; the charity provides no evidence to confirm or deny this). The rating of 3 assumes that the surgery can on occasions be life-changingly positive, and in other cases would render the beneficiary's life not materially better - more evidence would be needed to justify a higher rating. Update: found some research here, which seems to suggest that it's moderately cost-effective: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20063097.

Born in a remote village in Tanzania, he was the only child his fellow villagers had known to be born with a cleft. Even relatives treated Osawa differently. He became painfully shy and never laughed, so to not draw attention to his cleft lip.
His mother was also subject to tremendous criticism, unjustly blamed by her in-laws for Osawa’s cleft. The family of six, including his father and three siblings, persevered, remaining close despite the stigma surrounding Osawa.
Thanks to Smile Train donors and the skilled surgeons at Comprehensive Community Based Rehabilitation Hospital in Tanzania, Osawa received the life changing cleft surgery that he so desperately needed.

According to ""Frequency of Lost Dogs and Cats in the United States and the Methods Used to Locate Them"" (www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/2/2/301/pdf) 15% of dogs are lost, and of those most are found by just searching the neighbourhood - only 14% of that 15% actually benefit from the microchip. In other words, only around 2% of those actually benefit from the chip, so that intervention gets a 1 out of 5 for its impactfulness. Neutering is also a valuable intervention because it stops the dog from breeding, which would be difficult to manage, however this is a qualified opinion, since according to http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/health/articles/neutering-male-dog.html , it can triple the risk of obesity, increase the risk of a cancer called hemangiosarcoma, triple the risk of hypothyroidism, increase the risk of geriatric cognitive impairment, and other risks. On balance it's still positive and gets a 4 out of 5. Caring for rehomed dogs is clearly 5 out of 5, since their condition without that care would be terrible."

Presumably it would be incorrect to take the annual number of beneficiairies as 600,000x12, since lots of those people would continue coming back from one month to the next.

The midwest food bank website says that their beneficiaries aren't always below the poverty line ""People living above the poverty line are often at risk of hunger as well"" (http://www.midwestfoodbank.org/how-we-help/hunger-is-real). So if the food bank were not there, would beneficiaries in the midwest still be able to eat by rationalising some other expenditure? Some of the beneficiaries are in E Africa, and it's difficult to find any information about who in East Africa is a beneficiary, however I suspect they are more likely to suffer or go hungry if not provided with food. No information is provided about the split between the E African beneficiaries and the American beneficiaries, or why it would be better to provide the African beneficiaries with food rather than money."

Ultimately though, the opportunity to have a positive cinema experience, while a good thing, is not obviously a top giving opportunity given how much more life-changing things can be done for cheaper.

The use of teenage mothers as staff members also sounds like a strength of the model. The key question is the importance of the cause. I could find little information in the annual report to answer this question. I have tried looking for research to help understand the answer to this, and I can find many journal articles which baldly state/assume that teenage pregnancy is bad, but little to estimate how bad, or high how a priority it should be. When considering the overall assessment of the charity, it will be important to remember that the cost per beneficiary will appear low (around £40 at the moment) because it will reach lots of people, but most of them would not have become teenage parents anyway. The low impactfulness assessment largley also reflects the fact that most of the people in the audience would not have been involved in teenage pregnancy anyway, and hence will come away unaffected"

It would be important to chase up the source of the statistic to see whether the background to the calculation applies in a relevant way to Storybook dads. Gut feel without having seen the original source of the stat is that the effect is probably not a 6-fold improvement in recidivism rates; rather I think that those who are more dedicated to the idea of engaging with Storybook Dads are more likely to be dedicated to not reoffending when they get out. The rating of 3 out of 5 is based on the idea that maintaining a connection with the family can have a positive effect, albeit not a sixfold improvement (as well as the other benefits of the programme, of course). The info at http://www.researchgate.net/publication/269700976_Case_Study_Storybook_Dads seems positive as well. It left me somewhat confused about the reference to profitability though, how does that work? I'm also surprised that the charity can offer the service so cost-effectively - I say this partly because I would have thought that the recordings would need to be checked for the risk that the inmates smuggle out secret messages, and hence the recordings would need to be checked.

The info from Raise your Hands seems to suggest that they do manage to reach children from deprived backgrounds (see https://raiseyourhands.org.uk/news/raise-your-hands-visits-sparkplug/) However their write-up may perhaps overstate the situation - for example I suspect it's an exaggeration to suggest that Sparkplug is often a child's primary carer.

The intervention aims to reduce crime and anti-social behaviour, but there seems to be no reporting on whether this has happened at all; in the absence of any other information, my guess would be that the impact is slight - I would guess that some people have benefited from have decent role models and access to qualifications, but that these people were probably in the right place (psychologically) to make the most of the opportunities available and would have found something else anyway. Gut feel - this is not transformative."

However PHC's website states that ""THE COPENHAGEN CONSENSUS ESTIMATES THAT EVERY $1 SPENT ON FORTIFICATION RESULTS IN $9 IN BENEFITS TO THE ECONOMY.""

The Schistosomiasis control initiative uses a cost-effective school-based method to distribute cheap treatments to millions of people - mostly children.

Research also suggests that earnings improve significantly when the child grows up.

Besides, there is no data available on this (not that I have asked the Trust about this). Income generated from charitable activities has been excluded, which includes entrance fees, parking fees, revenue generated from the likes of on-site coffee shops and membership fees. Membership fees confer benefits such as free entrance to sites, so it makes sense to treat this as part of the income from charitable activities.",,,"£234,500,000",47%,"Confusing.

In 2013, with the support of the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Wolfson Foundation and many other funding partners, we began a project to make conservation improvements and to enhance the visitor experience. Two alms-houses flanking the Chapel were transformed into new interpretation spaces, a new visitor reception and improved staff and volunteer facilities were opened, while a ‘reflective garden’ was created at the back of the Chapel. Access for all visitors to the Chapel was improved and visitor facilities added.

The counterfactual here is that if the National Trust didn't look after these, someone else would own these pieces of land, and they might not look after them properly or make them available to the public. But they also might. Indeed some might argue that someone who has paid a lot of money to personally own land is actually more likely to take proper care of it than employees of the National Trust, however I have erred on the side of assuming that the National Trust has special expertise and is therefore better able to take care of its properties than a private owner. This is not enough to move the overall impactfulness score above the 1 level though, since this is fundamentally a nice day, and not something lifechanging."

The information/support/advice element of their work is suggestive of a 2 out of 5 rating, since it is good, but not transformative. I would adjust it up to a 2.5 because the 60,000 beneficiaries counted do not account for all the services - e.g. 20,000 talking books were made available. A material proportion of their income (40%) is income that is generated by charitable activities, which presumably means that for some of their activities some people will be excluded because they don't have enough money (v hard to be sure of this though, I struggled to find more information about this income when I looked at the annual report) This would count somewhat negatively towards the overall assessment."

Of these, 7,653 households began their training programme, with 1,620 households graduated."" I have ignored the figure about the people ""worked with"" who didn't start the training programme, but have assumed that those who started the training programme will have got some benefit out of it, and therefore there should be some credit for that. The 1620 households are the ones for whom there is the most benefit. Bizarrely the cost doesn't seem to have been given as a separate line item, so I had to add up the fundraising costs, the costs of charitable activities and governance costs. Note that some of the costs go on other capmaigning costs and other activities, which haven't been given relevant credit here.","£6,276,132","£7,026,847",,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,Email sent on 22/feb/16,,,,,B,3,"A video at https://www.sendacow.org/how-we-work shows that before their work, 23% of respondents were confident of being able to provide for their families, with 97% saying that they were confident after doing the training. Not clear how to reconcile this with the fact that only around 20% of those doing the course then ""graduate"" - I'm inclined to disregard the study shown in the video, as it seems likely that the respondents are biased to respond positively. And what's more, confidence doesn't really mean anything - the important question is whether they actually got a higher income at the end of it. I think the most important question is how big an impact does it make for he 1620 households who ""graduate"" - do they see a big increase in income? I'm going to guess yes.However the dilution effect means that the overall impact can't be too high - c 20% of the 7,653 beneficiaries will have a (presumably) big improvement lives, others a bit of help, and others minimal impact. Averaging this out to an impact of 3 seems right. More info may arrive, which may change this assessment. Note that a comparison with Bees For Development seems to suggest that BfD is much better, with a lower cost per beneficiary, and without any of the complications that arrive from giving goods to beneficiaries."

Could reasonably argue that the accounts say that the charity has zero impact, because the SOFA states (p11) that the expenditure is around two thirds fundraising costs and one third governance expenses, and zero on charitable activities. In reality, this is probably just poor accounting practice, since pages 20-21 seem to indicate that a material sum has been spent on guest speakers/preachers, radio/tv ministry and volunteer expenses. No mention was made of the sale of olive oil, however, nor of the 10 year battle against extradition from Kenya that Gilbert Deya faces, nor of the fact that his wife is guilty of child trafficking, although these facts have gathered more attention elsewhere (http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/charity-commission-investigates-charity-sells-healing-olive-oil/governance/article/1406256 http://www.itv.com/news/london/2016-01-25/archbishop-of-peckham-defiant-after-sting-reveals-fake-cancer-cure-claims/) Several of the cost items look surprisingly high - e.g. interest payable of £137k or legal fees of £85k. The interest of £137k and the depreciation of £54k may in fact be fine, given that the balance sheet seems to indicate that the charity does own property, however this would raise the question of why the charity needed to spend over £100k on rent.
