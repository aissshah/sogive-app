Fred explains: Take teaching Mathematics. Lots of teaching is done ‘outside under a tree’, since there are not sufficient classrooms. It is quite common for the teacher to write an exercise on the chalkboard and children try to work out the solution and write it down in their exercise book...And then the waiting starts.“The children line up to show their results to the teacher, which takes an incredibly long time. The teacher checks all results one by one, which means it might take up to half an hour just to check if each child has written down the right answer. Fred is working on a project called <a href source=\"https://www.vsointernational.org/fighting-poverty/improving-education/accelerating-learning-through-tablet-technology\">'Unlocking Talent Through Technology,'</a> in which iPads are being used to give children direct feedback on their learning. The ‘digital teacher’ immediately responds on any result that the child has found for his/her exercise. The project is currently reaching almost 25,000 children, and now has funding to roll out further and reach 55,000 children.
