Explanation of folder structure:

System is currently configured to either take a screenshot (when a test passes),
or to write a log entry with details of the last error encountered (when a test fails).

There was a bit of bother around getting timestamps/name of logs and screenshots to match
as these have to be done in different files (setup_script and custom-reporter). Dan decided
that you'd only want one or the other depening on how the test went anyway.
